Local + Remote Workshop Guidelines
==================================

**What it is:** A 3 hour lesson taught at a location which is then broadcast
to remote locations and also streamed to YouTube using Goolge Hangouts on Air.
The video and lesson materials will remain online indefinitely for future use.

**What this document is:** A description of the roles of people involved, materials, 
lesson timeline, used as well as examples of past lessons, and frequently asked questions.

Guidelines
----------

**People involved:** 

- **Instructor:** Responsible for teaching (using screen sharing on google hangouts), need to have solid draft of teaching materials two weeks in advance to be sent to room leaders at other locations and their helpers to allow time for everyone to review them. Also must do all local tasks (reserving room, have video and mic, send out installation instructions and registration information to their local site) or have someone at their local institution complete them.


- **Helpers:** Go over teaching material in advance to be able to help with questions and give instructors feedback during tech test, act as helpers in normal *Carp fashion. One helper at teaching location should be in charge of monitoring Etherpad for questions and answering them directly on the Etherpad (if they are simple) or relaying them to the instructor and typing the answer in the Etherpad, and there should be additional helpers at the instructor's location to help with questions around the room. It is recommended that each room should have 1 helper for every 10 learners (this can change based on lesson topic, level, or helper availability).

- **Room Leader:** At each location, one person should be in charge of making sure the technology is working. At Davis, this person is Jessica. At the location of the instructor, this is generally the helper in charge of answering questions in the Etherpad. At other remote classrooms, this is generally the person hosting the Google Hangout connection on their computer.

**Materials used:**
 
1. **Lesson** - Generally a webpage that contains lesson information. Examples include our `RMarkdown lesson <http://rpubs.com/marschmi/RMarkdown>`__, `pydoit lesson <http://www.camillescott.org/pydoit-intermediate/>`__, `Different Expression Using R lesson <https://github.com/mistrm82/msu_ngs2015/blob/master/hands-on.Rmd>`__.
2. **Etherpad** - should used for questions that arise during instruction. Students from all locations should be told that they can type questions there. The instructor can also ask if sites have any questions on topics, but the Etherpad is helpful during lectures because it doesn't interrupt the instructor. An example of an Etherpad from a past workshop is `here <http://pad.software-carpentry.org/2016-05-11-RMarkdown>`__. A new Etherpad can be created `here <https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/>`__, though the UC Davis organization person is happy to create this.
3. **Sticky Notes** - all local sites should have sticky notes in two colors, and use them to monitor room progress during challenge questions as is common with Software Carpentry (green = all good, red = help!)
4. **Projector** - to display your screen to your local classroom
5. **Video/Audio** - A laptop connected to a projector and Google Hangout has worked in the past, and a laptop microphone has worked well, though if you plan on moving around the room while teaching some instructors have used fancier microphones.

Helpful hints for the instructor
-------------------------------

* Make use of the Software Carpentry sticky note system, explain this before the workshop.
* Depending on audience level and workshop topic, go slow at first when introducing new software (such as R) and moving files into the correct location.
* Designate one local helper to be in charge of monitoring the Etherpad for questions posted by students. Answer questions when possible, and make sure the lecturer is notified of questions that can be addressed to them. Additionally, type the answers to the questions in the Etherpad for reference for everyone. (This is *very* appreciated by students!). Also, have this person monitor the etherpad chat. If the instructor asks if there are any questions from remote sites, it is much quicker for me to type "no questions!" in the chat than to unmute our microphone and answer verbally, and someone monitoring this chat can quickly convey that.
* When going over challenge questions, don't hesitate to ask remote sites what answers they came up with.
* Remember to repeat questions asked locally into the mic so remote sites and those watching the YouTube stream can hear them.
* If your internet connection drops you, you can rejoin the Hangout using the same invitation link.

Workshop timeline:
-----------------

**1+ month before:** Plan workshop with instructor, remote sites, advertise workshop at all sites

**2 weeks before:** Touch base with everyone involved, instructor should send out teaching materials to all sites, helpers go over materials, collect phone numbers from one person from each site (in case of tech problems)

**1 week before:** Do tech test/having meeting with all sites. Google hangout on air streaming to youtube. Verify everything works. (see: https://github.com/dib-lab/dib-training-private/blob/master/remote-tech-test-checklist.txt) The instructor can get feedback on teaching materials at this time. If the lesson has challenge questions, remote helpers can give feedback on how long they took to complete them to give the instructor an idea of their length.

**2-3 days before:** Send out workshop reminder email with location details, install instructions.

*Day of workshop:*

**10-15 minutes before lesson start:** Send Google Hangout on Air invitation link (instructions in `here <http://jessicamizzi.github.io/broadcast-hangouts/>`__, make sure it streams to youtube, have everyone join, keep remote mics muted.

**First 5 minutes**: Locally do introductions of helpers/room leader. Explain that workshop is being taught remotely on google hangouts, mention that remote mics are muted, so they should feel free to ask questions, show online teaching materials, show etherpad, explain etherpad chat is  where they can ask questions at any time, explain video will up on youtube so it can be referred to later, explain stickies. Have instructor explain etherpad again in case any local sites forgot to mention this.

**Halfway through:** Break for coffee for 10-15 minutes (this happens whenever is convenient for instructor)


**Same day as workshop:** Send workshop followup survey to participants, along with YouTube video, materials, and general DIB training info


NOTE: instructors should (be reminded to) repeat questions that are asked locally :)

Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------

1. Do participants need to register if they are not attending a workshop, only watching from home?

No, at UC Davis, participants only need to register if you will be attending our workshop in a classroom. This maybe be different at different locations.

2. As a remote instructor, do I need to host a learning site?

We strongly recommend that you do host a site, even if it is only a few people. This will allow you to observe how students are doing with the material, which is not possible if you are only teaching to your computer screen.

3. As the instructor, how do I keep track of the etherpad and teaching?

As an instructor, you will be sharing your screen to Google Hangouts on Air, so you will not be able to keep track of other screens at all times. Some instructors prefer to switch to the Etherpad to check it every so often, and others prefer to be notified by their helper monitoring the Etherpad of questions 

4. Do I need to create a Google Hangout and Etherpad?

No, UC Davis will do all the tech stuff. :)
