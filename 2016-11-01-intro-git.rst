Description
-----------


This workshop will introduce the basics of git, a widely used system
for managing changes to files.  Git and related systems are key for
replicability when doing any kind of computational analysis.

This will be a gentle introduction to git that follows the Software
Carpentry lesson.

Some experience with the command line is strongly suggested, but you
don't need to be an expert by any means; we will have friendly TAs,
too!

We will also talk about github, a site that enables collaboration
around files in git.
