Description
-----------

This half-day workshop will continue from the end of the 
Beginning Shell lesson (see materials here: 
https://github.com/ngs-docs/2015-shell-genomics/blob/gh-pages/README.rst).

We will cover loops, if statements, scripting, and I/O redirection (>, <, etc.).  
We will also talk a bit about how to put together shell scripts for 
job submission on queuing systems (‘qsub’ etc.).
