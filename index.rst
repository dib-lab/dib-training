Welcome to the Data Intensive Biology training program Web site!
================================================================

This is the overview Web site for the Data Intensive Biology training
program at UC Davis, run by `Dr. C. Titus Brown
<http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/>`__.  This is a series of workshops
primarily focused on sequence analysis, using a short-course format
taken from the `Next-Gen Sequence Analysis Workshops
<http://angus.readthedocs.org/>`__ and inspired by `Software Carpentry
<http://software-carpentry.org/>`__ and `Data Carpentry
<http://datacarpentry.org>`__.

* All workshops are on UC Davis campus unless otherwise specified.
* Workshops are open to everyone whether or not they are part
  of the UC Davis community, subject to space constraints.
* Workshops are free unless otherwise specified.

If you want to be notified of new workshops you can sign up for the
`dib-training mailing list
<http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/dib-training>`__; workshops are
generally announced there first.
