Description
-----------


Git and related systems are key for replicability when doing any kind 
of computational analysis. Topics covered in this workshop include 
branching and merging of repositories.

This workshop will be taught remotely and broadcast to our classroom
via Google Hangouts on Air. We will have helpers in our local room to
facilitate the lesson. The lesson will also be streamed to YouTube and
saved there for viewing at a later time. **You only need to register to
this event if you plan on coming to a classroom.**
