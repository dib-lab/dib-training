Description
-----------

This half-day workshop will introduce the topic of regular expressions
(using patterns to match strings) and how it can be implemented in the 
programming language Python. 

We will explore examples of using regular expressions find transcription factor 
binding sites and  to find regions of phage DNA (spacers) in bacterial genomes - key
parts of the CRISPR bacterial immune system. We will also explore how to build a test
suite for regular expression searches to ensure the regular expression pattern 
matching is accurate.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Please install **Python version 3 or higher**. `Python <http://python.org>`__ 
is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose
programming as well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
a bit difficult, so we recommend `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/anaconda>`__, 
an all-in-one installer. We also will be using the Python `screed <http://screed.readthedocs.org/en/latest/screed.html>`__ package. 
After installing Python (detailed instructions below), you can install screed by going to
the command line/terminal and typing: `pip install screed`

This session will be taught using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
Firefox browsers are all `supported <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility>`__
(some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).

**Windows**

1. Open `http://continuum.io/downloads <http://continuum.io/downloads>`__ with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for Windows.
3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation *except* make sure to check **Make Anaconda the default Python**.

**Mac OS X**

1. Open `http://continuum.io/downloads <http://continuum.io/downloads>`__ with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for OS X.
3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

**Linux**

1. Open `http://continuum.io/downloads <http://continuum.io/downloads>`__ with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.
3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation. (Installation requires using the shell). If you aren't comfortable doing the installation yourself stop here and request help at the workshop.)
4. Open a terminal window.
5. Type bash Anaconda- and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.
6. Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts.  When there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down arrow to move down through the text. Type "yes" and press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the default location for the files. Type "yes" and press enter to prepend Anaconda to your PATH (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
